			<h2>The Alien</h2>
			<p> Hi! My name is Julien, I'm a traveller that someday get really bored and decided to travel around the Earth. Yeah, that little pale blue planet. So, this is my logbook that describes my "adventures" in that Land of Nothing. I specially do this because humans usually think that they are really special, but they not, they are just inocent creatures. So this blog is for the ones who believes that their life on Earth is incredible and unique. Guess what? Not really. But I enjoy my trip, it's mostly harmless... (Oh, I almost forgot! My real name is 505876, but this blog is made for humans, so, call me Julien!)
			</p>
		<h2 id="page-subtitle">Life on Earth</h2>
		<p>
			Since I was born, I travel around the universe looking for partners to enjoy my ego trips. Recently, I come to Earth, and I found that weird creatures call <em> humans</em>.<br>
			It's very dificcult to make friends here. I'm really excited because this creatures are weird and so common at the same time, that make me feel like a stranger here.<br>
			Last night, I was walking and found this bizarre message. Seems like they have really doubts about us, other creatures who live in galaxy.<br>
			It's not just ignorant, <em> it's extraordinary because it's so inocent </em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before that, I realize that humans not just think they are unique in galaxy, but also <strong> they think they are important to somebody besides themselves </strong>. <br>
			Yeah, I know, I get shocked too. <br>
			It's very contradictory by the way, because the most people actually don't care for others. Including sometimes their own family, or children.<br>
			Some basic values to survive get losted in this crazy little planet.<br>
			I learned about <em>hipsters</em>.
			They are a group that really really believe that are super cool and super diferent, <strong><em> but they also common too (?). </em> </strong><br>
		</p>
		<p> I decide to take notes of the most bizarre things here:
		</p>

		<ul class="page-lists">
			<li>butterflies;</li>
			<li>comsumism;</li>
			<li>dollar or money in general;</li>
			<li>existencial crises;</li>
			<li>humans destroy everything and have no plans to build other place to live;</li>
			<li>airplanes.</li>
		</ul>

		<img src="./Butterfly.jpg" class="border-img" alt="butterfly" width="400">

		<p>
			Sometimes, I can understand them. <strong> I just can't believe that they actually live like this. </strong> <br>
			I found musics about other types of life, but seems like humans can't think in anyone except themselves. Listen to:
		</p>

		<ol class="page-lists">
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBu_bzxvgdI">Alien Days, MGMT</a></li>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDmvVilFeVQ">I Thought I Was An Alien, Soko</a></li>
			<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcpTLihMcm4"> Alien, Wild Nothing</a></li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			This 3 songs can explain better than me what humans seems to feel and <em>how they think about themselves, <strong>not about us.</strong></em><br>
			They are very strange, I know. Even when they try not to speak about them, they fall in their selfish egos. <br>
			However, I found this project called <em>Sleep Party People</em>. It's a band, but the concept of everything is just a man, named <em> Brian Batz. </em> <br>
			He's just like other humans, but his songs are very clever. The atmosphere seems like my trips around the Solar System. <br>

			Seems like, <strong>sometimes, some random humans can dream besides themselves and this pale blue planet.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			I make this table with some places that I'd like to vistit. I have been in the most, but Louvre it's the one that makes me more anxious.
